# Computer Networks Notes - Last Minute Revision âœ…

Here we have last minute revision notes of Computer Network. These questions will familiarize you with the most important computer network concepts and help you ace your job interviews ðŸ™Œ

## Most Asked Computer Network Interview Questions

## 1) Network:
An inter-connection of multiple devices known as host, that are connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data.

## 2) Network Topology:
Layout arrangement of different devices in a network.

## 3) Types of Topology:
1. Star -- Star topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a single device known as a central device
2. Ring -- Ring topology is a network topology in which nodes are exactly connected to two or more nodes and thus, forming a single continuous path for the transmission.
3. Bus -- Bus topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a single cable known as a central cable or bus.
4. Mesh -- Mesh topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are individually connected to other nodes.

## 3) Bandwidth:
Bandwidth is defined as the potential of the data that is to be transferred in a specific period of time. It is the data carrying capacity of the network or transmission medium.

## 4) LAN:
LAN or Local Area Network connects network devices in such a way that personal computers and workstations can share data, tools, and programs. A LAN typically relies mostly on wired connections for increased speed and security, but wireless connections can also be part of a LAN.

## 5) MAN:
MAN or Metropolitan area Network covers a larger area than that covered by a LAN and a smaller area as compared to WAN. MAN has a range of 5-50km. It connects two or more computers that are apart but reside in the same or different cities.MAN is designed for customers who need high-speed connectivity. Speeds of MAN range in terms of Mbps. Itâ€™s hard to design and maintain a Metropolitan Area Network.

## 6) WAN:
WAN or Wide Area Network is a computer network that extends over a large geographical area, although it might be confined within the bounds of a state or country. WAN has a range of above 50 km. A WAN could be a connection of LAN connecting to other LANs via telephone lines and radio waves and may be limited to an enterprise (a corporation or an organization) or accessible to the public. The technology is high-speed and relatively expensive.

## 7) VPN:
VPN or the Virtual Private Network is a private WAN (Wide Area Network) built on the internet. It allows the creation of a secured tunnel (protected network) between different networks using the internet (public network). By using the VPN, a client can connect to the organizationâ€™s network remotely

## 8) Advantages of VPN:
1.VPN is used to connect offices in different geographical locations remotely

2.VPN encrypts the internet traffic and disguises the online identity

3.VPN can be also used to bypass geographical locations.

## 9) IP Address:
An IP address represents an Internet Protocol address. A unique address that identifies the device over the network. IP addresses are displayed as a set of four digits. The total IP address range ranges from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. Example - 192.158.02.252

## 10) Differences between IPv4 and IPv6:
#### IPv4
- IPv4 has a 32-bit address length
- Address representation of IPv4 is in decimal
- It Supports Manual and DHCP address configuration
- In IPv4 Encryption and Authentication facility not provided

#### IPv6
- IPv6 has a 128-bit address length
- Address Representation of IPv6 is in hexadecimal
- It supports Auto and renumbering address configuration
- In IPv6 Encryption and Authentication are provided

## 11) HTTP and HTTPS:
- HTTP is the HyperText Transfer Protocol which defines the set of rules and standards on how the information can be transmitted on the World Wide Web (WWW). It helps the web browsers and web servers for communication. It is a â€˜stateless protocolâ€™ where each command is independent with respect to the previous command. HTTP is an application layer protocol built upon the TCP. It uses port 80 by default.
- HTTPS is the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure or Secure HTTP. It is an advanced and secured version of HTTP. On top of HTTP, SSL/TLS protocol is used to provide security. It enables secure transactions by encrypting the communication and also helps identify network servers securely. It uses port 443 by default.

## 12) DHCP:
DHCP is the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is an application layer protocol used to auto-configure devices on IP networks enabling them to use the TCP and UDP-based protocols. The DHCP servers auto-assign the IPs and other network configurations to the devices individually which enables them to communicate over the IP network.
