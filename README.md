Here we have last minute revision notes of Computer Network. These questions will familiarize you with the most important computer network concepts and help you ace your job interviews ðŸ™Œ

## Most Asked Computer Network Interview Questions

## 1) Network:
An inter-connection of multiple devices known as host, that are connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data.

## 2) Network Topology:
Layout arrangement of different devices in a network.

## 3) Types of Topology:
1. Star -- Star topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a single device known as a central device
2. Ring -- Ring topology is a network topology in which nodes are exactly connected to two or more nodes and thus, forming a single continuous path for the transmission.
3. Bus -- Bus topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a single cable known as a central cable or bus.
4. Mesh -- Mesh topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are individually connected to other nodes.

## 3) Bandwidth:
Bandwidth is defined as the potential of the data that is to be transferred in a specific period of time. It is the data carrying capacity of the network or transmission medium.

## 4) LAN:
LAN or Local Area Network connects network devices in such a way that personal computers and workstations can share data, tools, and programs. A LAN typically relies mostly on wired connections for increased speed and security, but wireless connections can also be part of a LAN.

## 5) MAN:
MAN or Metropolitan area Network covers a larger area than that covered by a LAN and a smaller area as compared to WAN. MAN has a range of 5-50km. It connects two or more computers that are apart but reside in the same or different cities.MAN is designed for customers who need high-speed connectivity. Speeds of MAN range in terms of Mbps. Itâ€™s hard to design and maintain a Metropolitan Area Network.

## 6) WAN:
WAN or Wide Area Network is a computer network that extends over a large geographical area, although it might be confined within the bounds of a state or country. WAN has a range of above 50 km. A WAN could be a connection of LAN connecting to other LANs via telephone lines and radio waves and may be limited to an enterprise (a corporation or an organization) or accessible to the public. The technology is high-speed and relatively expensive.
